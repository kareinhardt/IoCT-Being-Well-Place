### Daily_Report.gs

This Google Script is scheduled to run every day at 6 PM (after the closing time of Being Well Place). The script generates a report email detailing the total number of visitors to the Being Well Place and the times of their visits. The data is pulled from a Google Sheet, where visitor information is collected using Flic Buttons.
